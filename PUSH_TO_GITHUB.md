# Push to GitHub Commands

After creating your repository on GitHub, run these commands:

```bash
# Add your GitHub repository as remote (replace YOUR-USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/seaman-fresh.git

# Push your code
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an authentication error, GitHub will prompt you to login.

3. File → Add Local Repository → Select `d:\Enosh\smf`
4. Click "Publish repository"
